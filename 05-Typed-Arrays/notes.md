# Section 5: Mastering Typed Arrays

## Typed Arrays

- Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value

## Why do we care?

- TS can do type inference when extraction values from an array
- TS can provent us from adding incompatible values to the array
- We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' function
- Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types

## Where to use typed array?

- Any time we need to represent a collection of records with some arbitrary sort order
