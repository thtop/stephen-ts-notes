# Advanced Express and TS Intergration

## Matadata
- Proposed feature to be added to JavaScript (and thus, TS)
- Snippets of info that can be tied to a method, property, or class definition
- Can be used for super custom stuff
- Typescript will (optionally) provide type information as metadata
- Read and written using the reflect-metadata package
